short-description: Bloccit, an interactive clone of Reddit!

---

## Explanation

Bloccit is a clone of the popular website, Reddit. Bloccit contains a number of features such as user authentication, validation, test-driven development, Create Read Update Destroy (CRUD) actions, as well as an interactive comment feature.

## Problem

Build a fully-functioning replica of the popular website, Reddit.

## Solution

Bloccit was constructed over several weeks while working through Bloc's Rails curriculum. Each week brought a new set of challenges and concepts related to Rails development. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn while building this application. Learning the material, incorporating it into a web application, and seeing the end result was rewarding and helped reinforce the material.

## Results

After several weeks of patience and persistence, Bloccit came to life as my first web application. It was rewarding to see all of those weeks of hard work dedication shine in the end product. Bloccit taught me a lot of valuable lessons in terms of testing, styling, best practices, and other concepts that I would carry with me in the construction of future projects.

## Conclusion

Overall, I think Bloccit was a great foundation project. The most valuable takeaway from the project was being able to learn as I constructed my first web application. I enjoyed the challenges, research, and persistence required to bring Bloccit to life. I look forward to building the next project!

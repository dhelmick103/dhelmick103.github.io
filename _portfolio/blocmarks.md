short-description: Blocmarks, a social bookmarking page!

---

## Explanation

Blocmarks is a web application that allows user to bookmark URL's, view other user's bookmarks, and maintain
a library of their own bookmarks. Among other things, the site uses the Devise gem for sign up purposes, Create Read
Update Destroy (CRUD) Actions, and the ability to like and unlike bookmarks of other users.

## Problem

How to web application that allows users os send, manage, and share their bookmarks

## Solution

Using the material from the curriculum, internet resources, Udemy courses I did on my own time, and textbooks, I was able to complete my to-do list application per the criteria outlined in the project.

## Results

This project was fun to work on as it reinforced a lot of the material discussed in the curriculum, specifically related to testing, authorization, and validations. I enjoyed learning how to incorporate Mailgun into the application and adding the like & unlike features to bookmarks.

## Conclusion

Overall, I learned a lot from this project as I continue to build on development knowledge and skillset.

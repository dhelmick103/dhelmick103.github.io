short-description: Blocipedia, a wiki website!

---

Explanation

Blocipedia is an interactive wiki website. Registered users can create, share, and collaborate on private wikis. Authentication and sign in functions are driven by the Devise gem. Standard users can upgrade their membership to premium status through integration with Stripe. There are 3 roles including admin, standard, and premium, all of which have customized access driven by Create Read Update Destroy (CRUD) actions.

Problem

Blocipedia was the first project that I created on my own. It was exciting to be 'turned loose' from the curriculum and have the freedom to create my own project, yet stay within the framework of the loose application requirements.

Solution

Using the material I learned through the curriculum along with new knowledge acquired via internet resources, Udemy courses, and textbooks, I was able to bring a fully-functioning wiki website to life.

Results

I am proud of the end product considering that Blocipedia was my first project built on my own. It was rewarding to see all of my research, persistence, and hard work pay off.

Conclusion

I continued to build on knowledge of Rails with Blocipedia. I learned several new tasks like working with the Devise Gem for signing up and out of the application, the Pundit Gem for authorization, and incorporating Stripe to upgrade a user to premium membership. I was also able to incorporate a bootstrap layout from getboostrap.com in order to provide for a clean layout and carousel theme among other features.

Explanation

Blocitoff is a self-destructing to do list application. It incorporate the devise gem for user sign in and out. Blocitoff allows users to create reminder lists which expire after 7 days.

Problem

How to create stylish and formidable to-do list application

Solution

Using the material from the curriculum, internet resources, Udemy courses I did on my own time, and textbooks, I was able to complete my to-do list application per the criteria outlined in the project.

Results

Blocitoff was a fun introductory project in which I continued to build on my development skills. I used the Devise Gem in order to sign up and sign out users. I constructed partials so that users could submit new to-do items. I used the Faker Gem in order to seed fake to-do tasks into the database. Other features incorporated into Blocitoff include the ability to mark to-do items complete, display the time remaining for an item, and delete expired to-do items.

Conclusion

I am please with how Blocitoff turned out. Blocitoff was another great introductory project in which I continue to learn the Rails language and sharpen my development skills.

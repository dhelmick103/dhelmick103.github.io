short-description: Blocjams, a digital music player !
---

I am pleased to announce that I have made it through the curriculum portion of the course!  I'd like to take this opportunity to share what I have been working on over the last month or so.  Along with learning the curriculum of frontend web development, I have been constructing my first web app called Bloc Jams.  Bloc Jams is a digital music player that incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Let's walk through the steps I took to bring this application to life.  

HTML & CSS: Basic Structure
In this task, I created the basic framework for Bloc Jams including the index page, as well as tags to organize content in what will eventually become a digital music player.

HTML & CSS: Styles
In this task, I added CSS stylesheets to the application in order to add colors, fonts, and other style elements to the page.

HTML & CSS: Responsiveness
In this task, I incorporated the viewport meta tag in order to scale the page to fit on all devices such as tablets and desktop computers.  I also created a landing css file to style the landing page.  Breakpoints were added to style the main page depending on the width of the screen used to view the page.

HTML & CSS: Collection View
In this task, I created the collection page (and associated css file) to display available albums.

HTML & CSS: Album View
In this task, I created the album view (and associated album css file) so that users can learn more about the album they select.  The album page includes a cover image, information about the album, and an HTML table listing the songs of each album.  A max-width container was added for more responsive styling depending on the device used to view the page.

DOM Scripting: Animation
In this task, I incorporated CSS transitions as well as animations.  I also created a landing.js page.

In this task, I incorporated animations through the use of DOM events.

DOM Scripting: Collection View
In this task, created a template to add as many albums as necessary to the collection page using DOM scripting.

DOM Scripting: Album View
In this task, I replaced the static content in the album with dynamic script to pull information from album objects and display it in the album view.

DOM Scripting: Play/Pause Part 2
In these tasks, I used DOM scripting to both play and pause songs in the library.

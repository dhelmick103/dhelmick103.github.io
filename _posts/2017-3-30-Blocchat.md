I am pleased to write that I have completed another project, Bloc Chat.  Bloc Chat is a real-time client chat application built using AngularJS and Firebase.  The idea behind Bloc Chat was to establish a series of chat rooms and allow various users to message others in a respective chat room.  Here's a deeper look at the steps I took in order to bring Bloc Chat to life.  

List Chat Rooms

In this task, I added a list of chat rooms to the database in firebase.  Once complete, I created a room factory in Angular that defined all Room-related APIs.  I also created a controller and associated it with the home template.  Furthermore, I injected the Room service and displayed the rooms in the template using ng-repeat.

Create Chat Rooms

In this task, I included Bootstrap in the application and created the chat rooms.  I added the UI Bootstrap $uibModal Service to add a form to create a new chat room.  A separate controller was created for the modal and dependencies were injected for using the modal.

List Messages

In this task, I displayed a list of message by chat room.  I also created a message factory in Angular that defines all Message-related API queries.  Furthermore, I referenced the Firebase database and injected the $firebaseArray service provided by AngularFire.

Set Username

In this task, I set username to display in the chat rooms.  To accomplish this, I included the Angular cookies module and injected the ngCookies module into the dependency array.  In the event that a user name is not present, I added logic to prompt the user to enter one before entering their message.

Send Messages

In this task, I associated messages with a username in a chat room and took action to ensure that new messages are associated with no chat rooms other than the active one.

title: Amazon Alexa Project 
---

When I first began the Frontend curriculum, I was looking forward to building a skill for the Amazon Alexa platform.  As part of the project, I got the opportunity to create three skills, Rick Astley Trivia, Cat Facts, and Fortune Cookie.

In the first assignment, I was asked to create a trivia skill using one of the pre-defined templates.  I chose to create a trivia skill tailored to 80’s pop icon, Rick Astley.  Want to give it a try?  Simply command your Amazon Alexa device to “Alexa launch rickroll.”

In the second assignment, I was asked to create a fact skill using a pre-defined template.  Since I am a fan of all animals, I chose to create a skill called “Cat Facts” which will tell you over a hundred facts about our four-legged friends.  For more information, command your Amazon Alexa device to “Alexa, launch cat facts.”

For my third and final assignment, I chose to create a skill that generates a Fortune Cookie application that generates a random fortune when launching the skill.  Curious about your fortune?  Command your Amazon Alexa device to “Alexa, launch fortune cookies.”

Overall, the I enjoyed the Amazon Alexa project.  It was fun to create three skills and be able to test them through my own Amazon Echo.  I look forward to creating additional skills in the future.

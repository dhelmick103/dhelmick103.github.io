For the last several years, I have taken a keen interest in technology, ranging from video games to computers and more. While the interest was certainly there, I had never really taken the step towards making my hobby into a career. That all changed when I read an article from the New York Times that was published on July 28th, 2015. Here's a full link to the article: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/technology/code-academy-as-career-game-changer.html?_r=0

The article highlighted Paul Milton, a 26-year-old math major who made the transition from making $20,000 a year as a waiter to a developer making over $100,000 at a startup. What an incredible story to see someone make such a turnaround in just three months. At that moment, I wanted to know more.

The first person I reached out to was my older brother, Mike. Mike is a Software Engineer at Google and the resident family expert regarding technology. I ran the article by him and he advised me take a few CodeCademy Courses to see how I enjoyed it. I followed through on his advice, took several courses on HTML, JavaScript, and Rails, and was instantly hooked.

The next step was finding a program that would suit my goal of becoming a web developer while being flexible to my schedule as well. I looked at several options, both online and in-person. The Cincinnati area where I live isn't exactly Silicon Valley so the in-person options were rather limited. I came across one development camp in town; however, that would have required me to quit my job and learn in a classroom setting for 8 weeks straight. I wanted a little more flexibility than that. As a result, I started researching online or virtual developer programs on Course Report.

One program that stood out to me was Bloc. They offered a flexible schedule, giving me the option to work at my own pace which was a big plus. I could also maintain my job while working on the program and take time off if I was traveling or needed a break. The cost was competitive relative to equivalent development programs. The ratings from students were favorable as well.

Another aspect that stood out was mentorship. Each week, I would have a one-on-one virtual appointment with a mentor to review assignments, ask questions, and learn the business from an expert in the field. I also liked the idea of being able to build projects throughout the curriculum to showcase to employers after completion of the program.

After careful consideration among several options, I settled on Bloc's Full-Stack Web Development Program and am ready to begin in November 2015. I will start off with the Rails, or back-end portion of the program for about eight months, then move on to the front-end part of the curriculum. I look forward to building stylish applications, learning to code, and further pursuing my interest in technology.

Wish me luck as I start on my new journey!

Having completed the curriculum phase of the course in October, the project phase is well underway.  In fact, I have wrapped up three projects to date, including the Amazon Alexa Project, Bloc Pong, and the Introduction to AngularJS project.

In the Amazon Alexa project, I developed three skills (Cat Facts, Fortune Cookie, and Rick Astley Trivia) which are now live on the Alexa platform.  In the Bloc Pong project, I built a replica of the classic arcade game, Pong, using the HTML canvas element.  I didn’t play a lot of pong in my childhood; however, I could play the version I built for hours.  It feels much more rewarding to play a game that I built rather than one on a game console.   

I am still wrapping up the Bloc Chat project which is basically a chat room consisting of dedicated rooms and users which incorporates Google’s Firsebase.  I look forward to wrapping that project up in the near future.  

I have learned a great deal from each project and look forward to working on my next project, Bloc Chat!

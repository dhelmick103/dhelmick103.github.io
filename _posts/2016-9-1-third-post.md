It’s hard to believe that my programming journey, which started in November of 2015, is halfway over.  I am please to announce that I finished the Rails portion of the curriculum and look forward to moving on to the Frontend section of the course.  I learned a lot in the Rails section of the course.  I enjoyed the challenges of learning Ruby and demonstrating my knowledge in a series of projects, including Bloccit, Blocipedia, Blocitoff, Blocmarks, and Blocmetrics.  The level of thinking and problem-solving aspects are certainly different than my average day as an investment analyst; however, I love the the challenge and high-level thinking required to be a programmer.  I am excited to build on my foundational knowledge and learn both Frontend and other programming skills.

I am currently on a one week break as I diligently work to complete the pre-work assignments required of Bloc’s Frontend course.  I am nearly finished with the pre-work and look forward to getting started on the next phase of Bloc, Frontend.  The Frontend part of Bloc should last around nine months, giving me a tentative completion date of May 2017.  

Looking ahead to some of the Frontend projects, I am excited for what lies ahead.  I have already decided that I am going to build a replica of the classic arcade game, Pong, using the HTML Canvas.  My interest is also peaked by the Amazon Alexa project in which I will construct three skills to launch on Amazon’s Alexa platform.  I also look forward to learning the ins and outs of Angular, Firebase, and other resources covered by the curriculum.  

As mentioned earlier, I am halfway home.  Nine more months until I complete my goal.  Let’s do this!

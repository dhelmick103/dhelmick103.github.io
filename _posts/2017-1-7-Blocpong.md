Happy New Year and welcome to 2017!  This marks my first blog of the new year.  I am proud to report on another project milestone in that I have completed another project, called Bloc Pong.  Bloc Pong is a replica of the classic arcade game, Pong.  The idea is to outscore the computer; furthermore, the first player to 11 points wins the game.  

Bloc Pong was constructed using the HTML Canvas functionality.  I enjoyed constructing the game as well as learning about both HTML Canvas and JavaScript throughout the project.  For more information about Bloc Pong, I invite you read about the steps I took to bring the project to life.  

Create Visuals
In this task, I created a number of elements including the table, paddles, and ball

Control the Paddle, Animate the Ball, Create the Computer AI
In these tasks, I wrote code to both move and control the paddle, I put the ball into motion and ensured that it would collide with the sides of the canvas, and I animated the computerâ€™s paddle and also wrote code to serve the ball once either player had scored.

Display the Live Score
In this tasks, I wrote code to display the score using the innerHTML property.

End the Game
In this task, I capped the score so that either the player or computer would win once the their score reached 11 points.  Once 11 points are reached by either user, the game ends.  The user will need to refresh the browser to play again.

After a long delay between blog entries, I am pleased to provide an update on my progress through Bloc. I made it through the entire curriculum and am finishing up several web applications I built using knowledge gained from the curriculum, books I read on the side, Udemy Courses I took in my spare time, as well as other resources.

While there were certainly challenges along the way, I am pleased with my progress to date. The challenging curriculum motivated me to bring my "A" game over the first several months as I learned foundational topics like testing, Model View Controller (MVC) convention, CSS, authentication, validations, and many other concepts. With each passing day, I become more confidant in my development skills and problem solving ability.

Following the curriculum phase, the program shifted emphasis towards more of a project aspect. I was provided wireframes and loose directions on the construction of various web applications of my choice. In addition to the Bloccit application I created during the curriculum, I was able to add four more applications to display in my portfolio.

These projects include Blocipedia, Blocmetrics, Blocmarks, & Blocitoff. These foundational projects were really fun to build as I got to show off my creative side while still having the comfort of defined guidelines to construct each project. While I am still building several projects, the 'meat' of the applications is already complete. At this point, I am adding some styling, CSS, layouts, and some other features to polish up the applications. While styling and CSS was not a big emphasis during the Rails course, I feel that I am setting my applications apart by adding some flair and also setting myself up well for the front-end curriculum given that these topics will be a bigger emphasis there.

In addition to the projects I am working on, I am taking several courses on Udemy to solidify my skills. These courses walk through building applications step by step, review best practices, and have been a great learning experience. I am also enjoying some of the books I am reading on the side such as the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (Hartl), Learning Web Design (Robbins), as well as the HTML/CSS and JavaScript/Query books by John Ducket.
